# This is a small guide to using the built image

    To build your image, you have to be in the same directory of the 
Dockerfile and need to run this command:

$ docker build -t <nameofyourchoice>

    In a second moment you have to run your container with some privileges.     
So the command to run the container is different of the others common docker commands. 
You will use --net="host" to use the interfaces wireless of your computer and --privileged to get priviliges. 
The --name is optional, you can use it if you want to name your container. Therefore, the command will be like this:

$ docker run -it --net="host" --privileged --name <containername> <imagename> /bin/nash
